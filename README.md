UART Automatic BAUD RATE DETECTOR
I found this project in #efy (electronics for you) monthly magazine and
I tried this using two Arduino, one is the baud rate generator and another one is the tester.
it's working as expected and the results are verified. 
and I found that this concept can be used when we develop a UART-based device and the baud rate can be flexibly configured to the existing setup.
